<h2 align="center"> Hey, Jared here! </h2>

I'm currently serving the Singapore Armed Forces as a Cyber Specialist Cadet, and intend to pursue degrees in Business Administration and Computer Science simultaneously offered by the National University of Singapore. 

In my free time, I tinker with machine learning models, specializing in image processing and multiple instance learning.
